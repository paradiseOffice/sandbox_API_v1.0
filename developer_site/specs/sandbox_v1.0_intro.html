  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>A description of the underlying API for the Paradise Office suite, called 'Sandbox'. How to use the API to build web applications. This document is intended for those with some programming knowledge. The Paradise Sandbox is a set of functions written in common web programming languages to greatly simplify building complex web applications such as a word processor for instance. The 'Cygnet' language is a method of calling functions, and is an easy language used to construct applications without any computer programming experience.</p>

<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>The functions are grouped into areas such as data processing, UI elements and threads (for faster program execution).</p>
<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
<p>There aren't any issues except for maybe software patents held by big companies</p>
